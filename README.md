# FaceIt - Unsupervised Facial Clustering in Image Data

This project is designed with the goal of implementing unsupervised facial clustering within image datasets. Our primary objective is to efficiently organize photographs from events by identifying and grouping images based on the faces of individuals captured in them. Utilizing advanced techniques in unsupervised learning, the project focuses on the nuanced task of detecting and clustering facial features, thereby facilitating a streamlined and intuitive organization of event photos. This approach not only enhances the accessibility of specific images within large datasets but also brings a novel perspective to photo management and organization driven by facial recognition technology.
